    <h3>Why Edgeworth is my hero</h3>
    <p>The main reasons I consider Edgeworth my hero is that he is able to keep his cool and think logically to solve problems instead of panicking and freezing up. He has moments of weakness, and during that he relies on other people for support, which shows how it's alright to rely on other people instead of going through life alone. A final point is that he is able to recover from past trauma and struggles to continue on, and he doesn't choose the easy paths. Instead, he selects the difficult ones that lead him to self-discovery. I find that motivating when life gets difficult.</p>
